    'about_text' => 'Ximos Started its business dealing with “Schotkky Barrier Diode”, and has become a company with 6 to 7 tears of market developing experience which is also always looking for improvement. Now, we keep developing our distribution chain. Our main sales areas are Taiwan, Japan, Korea, China and Vietnam. We run our company with passion towards the market and our products.<br>
                    I hope that Ximos becomes a company which both our customers and business partners can fully trust. We always hope for a long term relationship when an opportunity comes up. Even if we can not cooperate right away, it is helpful to have a friend. Our partners who are all over the world, maybe some of them are the ones you are looking for.<br>
                    To Our Staff: <br>
                    I do not want Ximos to just be a company, I hope it feels more like your second home. I hope that all staffs can treat each other like their own family members which involves good communication and cooperation. And my job is to ascertain a healthy, comfortable environment so that everybody can grow and improve together intellectually and socially. No matter it is during the Japanese classes provided in the company, or during our weekly meetings, even our monthly meetings, they are all great learning opportunities which I hope you seize. It is because of your enthusiasm and your passion that Ximos keeps getting better and better. I appreciate deeply and am sincerely grateful for all of your hard work.<br>
                    In the future, Ximos Technology will become the staffs biggest support and become the most trustworthy supplier for our customers.<br>',
